---

A slow query tells you *what* is slow. It never tells you **where**, and a tool that points at
`vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Connection.php:365` has told you nothing at all.

This package sends [Slowpoke](https://github.com/christiancannata/slowpoke) the file and line of **your**
code behind every query — for every request, every queued job and every scheduled command:

```
GET /orders/{id}                                    820 ms · 34 queries
  select * from orders where id = ?                   4 ms   app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php:42
  select * from users where id = ?                    3 ms   app/Models/Order.php:88   ← ×31, one per order
  select sum(total) from invoices where order_id = ?  9 ms   resources/views/orders/show.blade.php:17
```

That last column is the whole point. Slowpoke turns it into N+1 detection and missions that name a file,
each with a price in seconds of waiting per day — so the argument about what to fix first is over.

**Jobs and cron too.** A queued job and a scheduled command are not endpoints, and the package does not
pretend they are: they go to the Jobs page with how long they took, how often they failed and the same
`file:line` for their queries. Nobody is waiting for them, which is exactly why nobody notices when they
get slower.

## Install

```sh
composer require slowpoke/laravel
```

That is all. The service provider is auto-discovered and the package talks to the Slowpoke agent on the
same machine, which needs one line in `/etc/slowpoke/agent.yaml`:

```yaml
sources:
  - type: otlp          # listens on 127.0.0.1:4318
```

No OpenTelemetry SDK, no PHP extension beyond the defaults, no code to change, no key to carry, no account
anywhere. `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=slowpoke-config` if you want the config file in your repo.

## Performance

The rule this package is built on is the one the whole project follows: **never make the application
slower**. Measured, not claimed, and you can run it yourself with `./bin/bench` — everything the package
does *while a request is running*: the query listener, the line behind each query, building the trace.

| | PHP 7.4 | PHP 8.3 |
|---|---|---|
| per query | 2.0 µs | 1.9 µs |
| **a request with 50 queries** | **0.10 ms** | **0.09 ms** |

For scale: a request that spends 800 ms in your code and your database pays about **one ten-thousandth** of
that to be measured. Everything else happens **after** your visitor already has the page:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Sent after the response** | from a terminating callback: under php-fpm the response has already reached the client (`fastcgi_finish_request`), so the send is on nobody's clock. Queue workers send right after each job |
| **Never waits** | a hard time budget on the socket (`SLOWPOKE_TIMEOUT`, 0.1 s) and every error swallowed: an agent that is missing, slow or broken costs one trace, never a request |
| **Never copies your data** | `debug_backtrace(DEBUG_BACKTRACE_IGNORE_ARGS)` with a bounded depth: no argument, ever |
| **Bounded** | 500 queries described per request at most, the rest counted; statements over 10 000 characters cut |
| **Quiet when idle** | queries outside a request, a job or a scheduled command — a worker polling its queue, an artisan command you ran by hand — are not recorded at all |

659 lines of PHP. Three Laravel contracts. No runtime dependency of its own.

## What is sent, and what never is

Sent, as OTLP/JSON, only to the agent on your machine or private network:

- **per request** — method, route template (`/orders/{id}`), status code, start and end time. When no route
  matched, the path without its query string;
- **per job** — the job class, the queue name, whether it failed;
- **per scheduled command** — the command as you wrote it in the scheduler (`invoices:close`), how long it
  took, whether it failed;
- **per query** — the SQL **with placeholders**, exactly as Laravel hands it to PDO, the database engine,
  the real duration, and the first line of your own code on the stack, outside `vendor/` and outside this
  package. For a query issued from a Blade view: the template, not the compiled file.

**Never sent** — binding values, request parameters, headers, cookies, session, the user, exception
messages. If you write literal values into raw SQL yourself (`DB::select("… where email = 'a@b.c'")`) they
are part of the statement, and the agent redacts them before anything leaves the machine.

## Configuration

Everything has a default that works. Nothing has to be set.

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `SLOWPOKE_ENABLED` | `true` | `false` turns everything off: no listener, no middleware, nothing sent |
| `SLOWPOKE_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `http://127.0.0.1:4318/v1/traces` | plain http to a local or private host only (private ranges, `localhost`, a Docker service name, `.local`/`.internal`); anything else is ignored |
| `SLOWPOKE_TIMEOUT` | `0.1` | seconds to connect, then to hand the trace over; past that it is dropped |
| `SLOWPOKE_SERVICE` | `APP_NAME` | the name of this app in Slowpoke |
| `SLOWPOKE_JOBS` | `true` | trace queued jobs too |
| `SLOWPOKE_SCHEDULE` | `true` | trace scheduled commands (`app/Console/Kernel.php`) |
| `SLOWPOKE_MAX_QUERIES` | `500` | queries described per request or job; the rest are counted |
| `SLOWPOKE_MAX_SQL_LENGTH` | `10000` | longer statements are cut |
| `SLOWPOKE_BACKTRACE_LIMIT` | `60` | stack frames inspected to find your line |
| `SLOWPOKE_CODE_ROOT` | `base_path()` | file paths are sent relative to it |

## Compatibility

| PHP | Laravel |
|---|---|
| 7.4 | 5.8, 6, 7, 8 |
| 8.0 | 9 |
| 8.1 | 10 |
| 8.2 | 11 |
| 8.3 | 12 |
| 8.4, 8.5 | 13 |

Every combination in that table runs the full suite on each push and every week. Other combinations Laravel
itself allows (PHP 8.3 with Laravel 10, say) work too: the package is written in PHP 7.4 syntax and uses
only APIs present since Laravel 5.8. **A ten-year-old application gets the same answers as a new one.**

## Quality

| | |
|---|---|
| **49 tests, 170 assertions** | on every PHP and Laravel combination above, on each push and weekly |
| **Same wire, both sides** | `spec/laravel_otlp_fixtures.json` in the Slowpoke repository holds payloads exactly as this package sends them, with what the agent must read from each. The agent's Go tests replay that file: a change here the agent cannot read fails there |
| **PHPStan level 6** and `composer audit` | in CI, on every push |
| **CodeQL** and **OpenSSF Scorecard** | on the code and on the workflows, which are pinned by commit |
| **Signed provenance** | every release archive carries a Sigstore attestation |

```sh
./bin/test 8.3                                # PHP 8.3, latest Laravel
./bin/test 7.4                                # PHP 7.4, Laravel 8
./bin/test 7.4 'orchestra/testbench:3.8.*'    # PHP 7.4, Laravel 5.8
./bin/test 8.3 --filter OriginFinder          # extra arguments go to PHPUnit
./bin/bench                                   # the numbers in Performance, on your machine
```

Everything runs in Docker. Nothing is installed on your machine.

## Security

It reads no request data, sends nothing outside your machine or private network, and cannot break or slow a
request. What it does and never does, how to report a vulnerability and how to verify a release are in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md):

```sh
gh attestation verify slowpoke-laravel-v0.1.2.zip --repo christiancannata/slowpoke-laravel
```

## License

MIT, see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Slowpoke itself is free and self-hosted: the measures stay on your machines,
and nothing about your application ever leaves them.
